# YAB for eex/leex README

> **Warning**
> This extension is deprecated in favour of the heex formatter, that is shipped with live view

"Yet another beautifier" for elixir eex/leex html templates. Like others it utilizes htmlbeautifier. The
difference is, it can format without saving the file first.

`htmlbeautifier` needs language settings to be set in the environment to handle utf-8 charsets - like umlauts.
On Macs the LC_* environment variables are not set by default. This extension will set them to `en_US.UTF-8`
if not set.

## Features

* Formats eex / leex files without saving or producing tmp files.
